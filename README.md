# Jumper
Guess the correct word before the parachute is completely gone!

---
## Getting Started
The terminal will display a prompt for a letter to guess. Do not enter more than one letter at a time and do not add any spaces before or after the letter. Case does not matter. If you guess a correct letter it will be displayed. If you guess wrong a portion of the parachute will be removed.

## Project Structure
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- Classes             (class source code folder)

+-- README.md           (general info)
